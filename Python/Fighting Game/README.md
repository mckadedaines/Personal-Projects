# Overview

As a software engineer with a passion for gaming and programming, I embarked on a project to create a unique gaming experience that blends elements of adventure with the competitive spirit of fighting games. "Guild Quest: Mithril's Trial" is a testament to this journey, offering players a chance to step into the shoes of Michael, an aspiring adventurer determined to rise through the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild and achieve Mithril status.

In this game, players navigate Michael through a vibrant pixel world, mastering combat techniques and exploring dynamic environments. While initially envisioned as a 1v1 Smash Brothers-style fighting game, "Guild Quest" currently focuses on single-player mechanics, including platforming challenges and combat against environmental obstacles. Future updates aim to introduce NPC adversaries, enriching the competitive aspect and narrative depth.

This project was not just about building a game but also about pushing my boundaries in software development, problem-solving, and creative storytelling.

# Development Environment

The game was developed using Pygame, a popular set of Python modules designed for writing video games. Pygame offers the functionality needed to create game applications, including rendering graphics, capturing input events, and managing sounds.

**Tools & Technologies:**

- **Pygame:** For all game development aspects including graphics rendering, event handling, and sound management.
- **Python:** The main programming language used to implement game logic and structure.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My primary IDE for writing and testing the code, thanks to its excellent support for Python and its myriad of helpful extensions.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found several websites invaluable for learning game development concepts, Pygame-specific techniques, and general programming best practices:

- [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) (for exploring similar projects and code examples)
- [Pixel Art Tutorials](https://www.lospec.com/pixel-art-tutorials) (for creating character and environment designs)

# Future Work

Though "Guild Quest: Mithril's Trial" has reached a playable state, there's much more I envision for its future. Here are some areas I plan to focus on:

- **NPC Combatants:** Introduce an AI-controlled character to spar against, bringing the original 1v1 fighting concept to life.
- **Level Design:** Expand the game world with more varied and challenging platforms and obstacles.
- **Story Elements:** Enrich the narrative with quests, dialogues, and characters to meet, offering a deeper gaming experience.
- **Multiplayer Functionality:** Explore the possibility of adding local or online multiplayer modes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Ensure the game runs smoothly across a wide range of devices.
- **Audio Enhancements:** Incorporate a wider variety of sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming atmosphere.
